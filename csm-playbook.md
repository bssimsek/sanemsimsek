# CSM Playbook (Lite)

## 1) Operating Rhythm
- **Weekly:** team standup (risk flags, actions), deal/expansion sync with Sales.
- **Monthly:** MBR (logo risk, product adoption, NRR progress, top escalations).
- **Quarterly:** QBRs with customers (outcomes vs. plan, roadmap, new value cases).

## 2) Segmentation & Coverage
- Tier by **ARR + strategic value + complexity**.
- Coverage model:
  - **Tier 1:** Strategic CSM + Exec sponsor + Solutions/TA
  - **Tier 2:** CSM pool + scaled enablement
  - **Tier 3:** Tech-touch + automation + webinars

## 3) Health Score (example signals)
- **Leading:** product adoption %, time-to-value, usage breadth, support velocity
- **Lagging:** renewals due, expansion pipeline, NPS/CSAT, exec engagement
- **Red flags:** sponsor churn, low activity, unresolved P1s, value not realized

## 4) Churn & Escalation
- Early warning rules → owner → action within 5 days
- Standard playbooks: adoption sprint, exec reset, success plan refresh
- Escalation ladder: CSM → CS Lead → Exec sponsor → XFN task force

## 5) Expansion Motion
- Success plan with quantified outcomes → identify expansion triggers
- Multi-thread with Sales; track expansion opportunities in CRM
- Land-and-expand offers (add-ons, seat growth, new modules)

## 6) KPIs
- **Portfolio:** NRR/GRR, churn %, expansion %, adoption %, QBR coverage
- **Ops:** time-to-value, time-to-green, case resolution SLA, feature adoption
- **Quality:** CSAT/NPS, exec sponsorship rate, value proof points per quarter

## 7) Tooling
- CRM (Salesforce) as source of truth; Gainsight (or equivalent) for health
- Single dashboard: risk list, adoption trends, QBR calendar, actions due
