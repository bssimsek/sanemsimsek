# Case Study — Marketplace Expansion & Retention Uplift

Inconsistent customer experience and low adoption in some regions led to churn risk and flat expansion.

- Standardized onboarding & integration; cut time-to-live by >30%
- Re-segmented accounts and refocused on productivity KPIs vs. pure footprint
- Ran exec-level governance with partners; co-built joint GTM plans

**Results**  
- Churn held **<3%**; merchant productivity **+20–25%**
- New business growth doubled to **7,000+ outlets**; GMV uplift target **+20%**
- Portfolio profitability **+11pp** after contract transitions

**Role**  
Built and led teams (40+ FTE) across 11 countries; drove cross-functional alignment (Sales, CS, Ops, Product, Finance).
